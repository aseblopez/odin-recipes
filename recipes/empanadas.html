<p>
  An empanada is a stuffed bread or pastry baked or fried in many countries of
  Latin America and the south of Europe. The name comes from the verb empanar,
  meaning to wrap or coat in bread. Empanada is made by folding a dough or bread
  patty around the stuffing. The stuffing can consist of a variety of meats,
  vegetables, or even fruits.

  Let’s start with the simplest, and probably the most popular. These are easy
  to find – especially after school hours when vendors are frying them up on the
  streets for students.

  In English, the name means ‘wind empanadas’. This is because they seem hollow
  when you tear them open, but really they are cheese empanadas. The shell is
  made from normal wheat flour, and cheese is sometimes incorporated with it.
  Other versions will have a dollop of salty cheese hiding in the corners. They
  are basically a fried cheesy bread. It’s a really delicious snack, but I
  wouldn’t eat one for a meal. Ecuadorians will sometimes have them for
  breakfast along with a hot cup of morocho, a white maize drink.
