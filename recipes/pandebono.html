<p>
  Pandebono is a type of South American roll or bagel prepared using two
  different types of flour and cheese. They are typically eaten a few minutes
  after coming out of the oven, though they can also be reheated, and are often
  enjoyed at breakfast or lunch with coffee or hot chocolate. There are a number
  of different stories as to the origin of the name, as well as where these
  rolls were first created and served. Pandebono can be quite quick and easy to
  make, and it is often available from South American bakeries or certain
  specialty bakeries in the US.

  While it is typically agreed upon that pandebono originated in Colombia, there
  is a great deal of speculation and disagreement over its precise origin. One
  story holds that an Italian baker who had come to Colombia invented these
  rolls. It is said that he would sell the rolls by shouting “pane del buono,”
  which means “good bread” in Italian, and which turned into “pandebono” through
  repetition. Other stories hold that it was first created by the owner of a
  small restaurant named Hacienda El Bono and the rolls were called pan del Bono
  or “bread from El Bono,” which was eventually shortened to “pandebono.”

<h1>Ingredients:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    2 ½ cups yuca or cassava starch - sometimes also called yuca flour or
    tapioca starch/flour
  </li>
  <li>
    4 cups grated mozzarella cheese can also use half mozzarella & half queso
    fresco or quesillo
  </li>

    4 cups grated mozzarella cheese can also use half mozzarella & half queso
    fresco or quesillo
  </li>
  <li>Pinch of salt</li>
  <li>
    1 stick of butter 4 oz or 113 grams, room temperature, cut into 8 pieces
  </li>
  <li>2 large eggs</li>
  <li>2-4 tablespoons of water or milk, add more if the dough is dry</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps:</h1>
<ol>
  <li>
    Combine the yuca starch or flour, cheese, baking powder and salt in a food
    processor, blend to mix well.
  </li>
  <li>Add the butter and eggs.</li>
  <li>
    Mix until small dough balls begin to form, if it's too dry add 1-2
    tablespoons of water or milk. Add more if needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove the dough from the food processor and roll into a ball, you can make
    the dough ahead and store in the refrigerator for up to a day.
  </li>
  <li>
    To make the dough by hand, combine all the ingredients in large bowl, using
    melted (cooled down) butter, and mix until you have a smooth dough. It's
    actually very easy to prepare by hand.
  </li>
  <li>Pre-heat the oven to 500 F.</li>
  <li>
    Make small round shaped breads with the dough and place on a cookie sheet
    with parchment paper.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake immediately or store in the fridge until ready to bake. I find that
    they turn out best if you do let them chill in the fridge for about 30
    minutes before baking.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the oven reaches 500F, turn on broiler, place the breads on the middle
    rack and bake until the breads are golden, about 5-7 minutes. Another option
    is to pre-heat the oven to 400F and bake at 400F for about 5 minutes and
    then turn on the broiler.
