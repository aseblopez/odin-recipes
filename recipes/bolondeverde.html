<h1>Bolon de Verde</h1>

<p>
  Bolón de verde (which translate into big green ball) has as its star
  ingredient green plantains, of which Ecuador is one of the largest producers
  worldwide.
</p>
<p>
  These fritters, considered the national dish of Ecuador, are made by cooking
  the plantains in boiling water (or frying them in oil), and then mashing them
  with a mortar and pestle while they are still hot. To this dough, some salt,
  cheese, chicharrón (pork cracklings), or ground peanuts are added and mixed
  together to form a ball the size of a fist.
</p>
<p>
  Once the balls are formed, these bolónes can be served immediately or fried in
  oil until the outside is golden and crisp. Some of the variations you can find
  now-a-days, have shrimp or herbs such as green onion and coriander. Some
  people also prepare it with ripe plantains.

  <li>1 tbs hot pepper or chili powder</li>

<h1>Steps:</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Melt the butter or lard over medium heat in large sauté pan</li>
  <li>
    Add the plantain chunks and cook for about 40 minutes or until they are very
    soft, turn them about every 10 minutes, they should be slightly golden but
    not too crispy.

    Mash the plantains using a wood masher – or just a regular potato masher –
    until you obtain chunky dough like consistency.
  </li>
  <li>
    Form balls slightly smaller than the size of a tennis ball with the dough.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make a hole in the middle of each ball and fill it with the cheese or
    chorizo or chicharrones (mixed with ground peanuts), gently press the
    filling into the hole, cover the filling and reshape it back into a ball
    shape.
