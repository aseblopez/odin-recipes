# odin-recipes

Started working on a new project

Created project file using terminal. Also conneced terminal with git and gihub. Opened Read.me file using terminal.

Created index.html file for working on project.

Went over how to committ and add to git and push the projects out to Git Hub. THis first push will be me practicing how to do so.

Changed title of index.html to empanadas.html. Started to put down html content in the page

went back to naming it index.html, realized I created the wrong page.

Created new directory within the Odin - Recipes directory "Recipes"
Added new html page "Empanadas" added link to page in the "index.html" page.
